No one can deny the importance of optimizing a website for search engines. It’s one part of digital marketing that can make or break a business. However, many people don’t realize that optimizing a website isn’t simply the job of the SEO specialist. The developers have to be involved as well. `,
    para1: `The importance of technical SEO is often underestimated. Unfortunately, many web developers don’t know how to optimize a website for search engines. But there is some good news: sometimes SEO professionals work with developers, so the two disciplines go hand in hand and complement each other!`,
    para2:
      "When it comes to technical SEO for web developers, there are some rules that every developer should know. For example, they must know how to redirect various types of URLs so that crawlers can index pages properly. They also need to understand how to create an XML sitemap, which is a list of URLs that helps crawlers understand the site structure. And finally, they need to be familiar with the robots.txt protocol, which makes it possible to block unwanted crawler activity on your website’s pages.",
    para3:
      "Technical SEO is about understanding how search engine crawlers index websites and ensure that your pages are optimized for them. It’s much more than just site architecture and the ability to build a well-structured site. Everything has to be done following search engine needs and with the end goal of improved organic ranking.",
    para4:
      "On the whole, web developers and SEOs need to work together to satisfy customers. Too often, web devs design and build websites without thinking of how search engines will rank them, and SEOs come in afterward trying to fix what should have been done right the first time. With both groups working together right from the beginning, customers will be happier with the finished product and with the results from their website’s search engine ranking.",
    para5:
      "Neither group can do their job well if they aren’t working together from the start. Web devs need to understand how search engines rank websites, and SEOs need to know how websites are coded and designed. By working together, they can create a website that is both pleasing to the eye and good for search engines.",
    para6:
      "For a website to truly be successful, both the SEOs and developers must work together to create a functionally and visually engaging website. By collaborating, they can ensure that the website meets all requirements and provides a great user experience. Their collaboration will result in a graphically good website with all the needed functionality without any SEO issues.",
    para7:
      "Developers work on creating a well-functioning website, while SEOs help to improve its visibility. By combining these two specialties, businesses can create a website that looks great and functions flawlessly.",
    para8:
      "A website that functions perfectly and looks professional can produce a high conversion rate, leading to more sales for the company. Additionally, a website that is both SEO and user-friendly usually ranks higher in search results than one without this advantage. ",
    para9:
      "A web developers’ job isn’t just coding. It’s also to ensure that the website is fully functional and no errors are present. As search engines crawl through pages, they may notice errors such as broken links, low loading speed, 4xx errors, etc., leading to a lower page rank. If there are errors on your website, Google may not even index it properly. ",
    para10:
      "Both groups can identify issues more quickly and fix them by working together. While SEOs are experts at identifying errors on the site that could affect rankings, developers can go in and correct these errors, so they’re no longer on the site. Without such a collaboration, these problems will likely exist for a longer time and can affect search engine rankings.",

    para1:
      "There is no right answer, of course. Choosing a first language will depend on what kind of projects you want to work on, who you want to work for, or how easy you want it to be. Hopefully, this guide will help give you a better idea of which one you should pursue.",
    title1: "Pythone",
    para2:
      "Python is always recommended if you’re looking for an easy and even fun programming language to learn first. Rather than having to jump into strict syntax rules, Python reads like English and is simple to understand for someone who’s new to programming. This allows you to obtain a basic knowledge of coding practices without having to obsess over smaller details that are often important in other languages.",
    para3:
      "Python also is ideal for web development, graphic user interfaces (GUIs), and software development. In fact, it was used to build Instagram, YouTube, and Spotify, so it’s clearly in demand among employers in addition to having a faster onboarding.",
    title2: "Javascript",
    para4:
      "JavaScript is another incredibly popular language. Many websites that you use every day rely on JavaScript including Twitter, Gmail, Spotify, Facebook, and Instagram according to General Assembly.",
    para5:
      "Additionally, it’s a must-have when adding interactivity to websites because it communicates with HTML and CSS. This makes it essential for front-end development and consumer-facing websites while becoming increasingly important in back-end development and growing in demand all the time. Because of its popularity, JavaScript is also the leading the charge in test automation frameworks, being the backbone of frameworks like Protractor and Nightwatch.JS.",
    para6:
      "There’s nothing to install with JavaScript since it’s already built into browsers, so it’s the easiest language to get started with in terms of set-up. The con here is that this means it’s interpreted differently across browsers (you’ll need to do some extra cross-browser testing) and may have deficiencies in responsive design compared to server-side scripts.",
    para7:
      "Again, while it’s not the most difficult to learn, it certainly isn’t as easy as Python. If Javascript does seem difficult at first, try out this Javascript tutorial that’s so easy a cat could do it.",
    title3: "C#",
    para8:
      "While C is one of the more difficult languages to learn, it’s still an excellent first language pick up because almost all programming languages are implemented in it. This means that once you learn C, it’ll be simple to learn more languages like C++ and C#.",
    para9:
      "Because C is more “machine-level”, learning it is great for teaching you how a computer functions. Software Developer Joel Spolsky compares it to understanding basic anatomy before becoming a medical doctor, making it the best way to code efficiently.",

Specify the purpose, like, "I want my site to provide training courses in the field of programming" and "or to improve and speed up the registration of students in our school".

Of course, there should not be so many content, elements that the website becomes crowded and chaotic, the mind of the audience is faced with an unclear message and gets confused. suitable websites have a clear structure and give their audience what they can get with the website and why they should care about it. For example, an online store should clearly state what can be bought in it and show the reason for it to the audience. This method greatly increases the value of your site, that's why the minimal and simpler design approach is these days (cuts all unnecessary noise and clutter and makes the main message clear, visible and understandable).",
