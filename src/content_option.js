    para0:
      'People ask the questions of "How does SEO work?" and "What does SEO entail?" but I will do you one better — "Why is SEO?" Why is SEO important to a website? Why would you want to optimize a website for search engines? Ultimately, it’s making your website show up in search engines in order to get more traffic. Obviously, you want traffic on your website, but the quality of the traffic matters — quality over quantity. What you are really doing is making the website a better answer for search engines so more people come to your site to see your services, products or information. ',
    title1: "What’s the reason for a website?",
    para1:
      "The first question to ask would be, “Why do you have a website?” The reason behind your website could be to help with sales, get leads and disseminate information. Generally, websites are not built to sit still and look pretty. That's not their job. Their job is to do something — to help people get information, to get leads, to sell stuff, to answer questions, to be newsworthy, to have great photos, to show off your videos. ",
    para2:
      "There are a hundred different reasons to have a website, but you need to find the reason for your website. Once you have a solid reason, make sure everyone who works on the site understands that reason. They can help the site clearly explain that reason to people visiting and the search engines looking at your site. If you are trying to sell something, make it obvious what it is, what it does, the price, how to add it to a cart, how to purchase it and how to pay.  ",
    para3:
      "What do you do when your entire reason for a website is just to disseminate information? There are goals with giving out that information. You want as many people as possible to see that information — for example, a site that answers questions about health and wellness and asks people to sign up for the newsletter. Because the end goal is giving out more information, it is a good idea to get a list of people who are into the same subject matter. With a community of like-minded people, you can share information, products and support. If your website is clear about that, it can bring the right people in, tell them to sign up for the newsletter and start creating a group.",
    para4:
      "New SEO tech requirements include useability, which is something you should want without Google telling you.",
    para5:
      "In 2021, Google’s update looked at technical requirements regarding useability that started to really influence rankings against other sites. Usability became a large piece of Google’s search algorithm. You want great usability for your website. People should be able to use your website easily and do either what they want or what you want them to do. Google realized that and looked at ways to judge it and make it part of the algorithm. If your site is hard to use, then Google doesn’t want to send people there just for them to be frustrated. ",
    para6:
      "Your website should have been focusing on useability before Google found it important. Now Google is looking at your usability versus the websites you are competing with. If all websites are terrible at usability, then you are equal. If one site is better at it, it will now rank higher. Are you sitting around wondering what happened in 2021? As people found your website difficult to use — because it loads slow or the layout is not user-friendly — Google noticed. You want that to be more obvious to you, so don’t wait until Google slaps your rankings. ",
    para7:
      "As your website becomes optimized for search engines, the important thing to think about is “Why is my website there? What does it do well? Who needs that information?” After that, you then consider “How can I make it easy for them to get what they need?” When you answer those questions, your website will start to flow. As you optimize for search engines, you will start being a great answer to a question and people will come to your site to get what you have.",
    para8:
      "Google is always trying to be better at answering questions. Someone asked the other day, “SEO is always changing. Does it seem to be a constantly moving target?” Not if you do it right, because Google’s ultimate goal is to get better at answering questions. It remains constant. Google wants to be the authority as the smartest answer to people's questions. If you optimize your website the right way with high-quality work aimed at being the best answer to the question, then you don't need to worry about the next update because you and Google are moving in the same direction. You're not fighting against the flow of Google's ultimate goal.",

Maybe the first thing that comes to your mind is the visual aspects such as colors, fonts, images or other aspects, but good design is really something much more complex than a pretty image without a specific purpose.",

In the following, we will check some of the things that make our design better and more appropriate",

    para6: `Every business has a purpose and every website expressive and symbolizes the purpose of your business. What is your purpose of having a website? The goal can't be something vague like "I want to have an educational website" because it's too general and a general goal will make your website look inappropriate. Specify the purpose, like, "I want my site to provide training courses in the field of programming" and "or to improve and speed up the registration of students in our school". Once you have a solid understanding of what exactly you want to achieve with your website, you can determine how the website should work to achieve it (what messages should be there or how the site should be structured).`,
    title2: "Usability",

      "If you want to keep your visitors and encourage them to return, you need to have a simple user interface. Most today people are impatient, if you make them think or work too hard, they will easily leave your website and never come back. If you own this online store, you need to make sure that the website has flawless search functionality, that products are clearly categorized and easy to compare, that the shopping cart is fully functional, and that browsing the site is easy and be clear.",
    title3: "transparency",

      "After determining the purpose of the website, you need to make it clear to your audience. Of course, there should not be so many content, elements that the website becomes crowded and chaotic, the mind of the audience is faced with an unclear message and gets confused. suitable websites have a clear structure and give their audience what they can get with the website and why they should care about it. For example, an online store should clearly state what can be bought in it and show the reason for it to the audience. This method greatly increases the value of your site, that's why the minimal and simpler design approach is these days (cuts all unnecessary noise and clutter and makes the main message clear, visible and understandable).",

This makes it essential for front-end development and consumer-facing websites while becoming increasingly important in back-end development and growing in demand all the time. Because of its popularity, JavaScript is also the leading the charge in test automation frameworks, being the backbone of frameworks like Protractor and Nightwatch.JS.",
    para6:
      "There’s nothing to install with JavaScript since it’s already built into browsers, so it’s the easiest language to get started with in terms of set-up. The con here is that this means it’s interpreted differently across browsers (you’ll need to do some extra cross-browser testing) and may have deficiencies in responsive design compared to server-side scripts.",
